<b> Connect-a-Coaster
<p>
The Connect-a-Coaster is my favorite roller coaster at the park. First you get on the ride at EN square, and then you start heading 
  up. You will start to go towards Ella's Park. Now you can whizz by the amazing ♥Heart-Coaster♥ where you will experience awesome loops,
  twirls, and corkscrews. After that, you will pass by Ella's Food. As you whirl through the air, you will see Karaoke Kingdom. This is
  the last part of Ella's Park. Yes, or Yes? You will choose while you zoom past the K-Pop Dance Generator. You will smell dumplings, tea,
  and more at N's Diner (陳申申的晚餐). Welcome to the City Of Light! As you sample awesomeness, the ride will end.

Life Is Like A Roller Coaster
  </b>
  <p>
Life is like a roller coaster
  <p>
It has some ups and downs
    <p>
Sometimes you can take it slow
      <p>
Or very fast
        <p>
It may be hard to breathe at times
          <p>
But you just have to push yourself
            <p>
And keep going
              <p>
Your bar is your safety
                <p>
It’s like your family and friends
                  <p>
You hold on tight and don’t let go
                    <p>
But sometimes you might throw your hands up
                      <p>
Because your friends and family will always be with you
                        <p>
Just like that bar keeping you safe at all times
                          <p>
It may be too much for you at times
                            <p>
The twists,
                              <p>
The turns,
                                <p>
The upside downs,
                                  <p>
But you get back up
                                    <p>
And keep chugging along
                                      <p>
Eventually it all comes to a stop
                                        <p>
You won’t know when
                                          <p>
Or how
                                            <p>
But you will know that it will be time to get off
                                              <p>
And start anew.
                                                <p>
Life is like a roller coaster.
                                                  <p>
