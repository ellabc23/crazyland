<b> Connect-a-Coaster
<p>
<h1>The Connect-a-Coaster is my favorite roller coaster at the park. First you get on the ride at EN square, and then you start heading 
  up. You will start to go towards Ella's Park. Now you can whizz by the amazing ♥Heart-Coaster♥ where you will experience awesome loops,
  twirls, and corkscrews. After that, you will pass by Ella's Food. As you whirl through the air, you will see Karaoke Kingdom. This is
  the last part of Ella's Park. Yes, or Yes? You will choose while you zoom past the K-Pop Dance Generator. You will smell dumplings, tea,
  and more at N's Diner (陳申申的晚餐). Welcome to the City Of Light! As you sample awesomeness, the ride will end.

Life Is Like A Roller Coaster
By Alex Schachter
Life is like a roller coaster
It has some ups and downs
Sometimes you can take it slow
Or very fast
It may be hard to breathe at times
But you just have to push yourself
And keep going
Your bar is your safety
It’s like your family and friends
You hold on tight and don’t let go
But sometimes you might throw your hands up
Because your friends and family will always be with you
Just like that bar keeping you safe at all times
It may be too much for you at times
The twists,
The turns,
The upside downs,
But you get back up
And keep chugging along
Eventually it all comes to a stop
You won’t know when
Or how
But you will know that it will be time to get off
And start anew.
Life is like a roller coaster.
