<b>
  Coaster of Love
</b>
When you enter the winding line of the Coaster of Love, you will see many paper hearts that our staff remake every day. You will have a
choice of seating. Each cubicle seats two and the pink squishy seats will make you want to ride time and time again. The beginning of the
ride is a giant hill. Then the real fun begins.
