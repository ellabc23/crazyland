  <p>MEILING: Whatever. Just never talk to me again.</p>

  <p>KAI: Why did you do that? I just spent the last hour on that drawing, and now it's ruined! Come on, sister!</p>

<p>MEILING: Hey Leila, how annoying was that kid earlier? It's like, he should know that you and I are both really popular and he isn't.</p>

<p>LEILA: And what does that matter?</p>
  
<p>MEILING: The rule of life is that popular people don't hang out with unpopular people unless they can gain something. If they bother you, just yell at them, they'll go away.</p>

<p>LEILA: I know that you're going to get really mad at me for saying this, but I don't agree. The kid from earlier was talking to me about my favorite book series, and since it's not exactly popular, that was the first person I've ever met who even knows about the books. Now you made it so that I can't talk to them ever again without 'ruining my social status.'</p>
